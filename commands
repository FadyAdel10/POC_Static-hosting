we create directory for each user under path: /home/fady/projects
then put files in that directory.
we have nginx configuration file: /home/fady/nginx.conf

we update hosts file to make project_name.user_name.CloudAstro.com maps to local host:

By append the following line in nano /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1   project_name.user_name.CloudAstro.com

then we run this command:

docker run --name nginx-server \
    -v /home/fady/projects:/home/fady/projects:ro \
    -v /home/fady/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro \
    -p 8080:80 -d nginx

and The generated links will be for ex: project_name.user_name.CloudAstro.com


note: 

127.0.0.1 project1.user1.CloudAstro.com

This entry ensures that when you type project1.user1.CloudAstro.com in the browser, the request is directed to your local machine (localhost), where Nginx will serve the content for user1's project.
